  <h1>Anne's Safe Nest 🕊️</h1>
  <p>You're safe here. This space is just for you — for the heavy days, the sad ones, or the ones you just need to breathe through.</p>

  <div class="button-group">
    <button onclick="showCard('sad')">🌧️ I’m sad</button>
    <button onclick="showCard('panic')">🌪️ I feel panic</button>
    <button onclick="showCard('shame')">🖤 I feel shame</button>
    <button onclick="showCard('guilt')">💔 I feel guilty</button>
    <button onclick="showCard('safe')">🌸 I want to feel safe again</button>

  </div>

  <div class="card" id="sad">
    <h2>It’s okay to feel sad</h2>
    <p>Your sadness is not a burden — it’s a sign of your depth. Let yourself feel. Then gently bring yourself back to softness.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card" id="panic">
    <h2>Let’s breathe together</h2>
    <p>In through the nose... hold... out through the mouth. Again. You are okay. You are not alone. You are not in danger right now.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card" id="shame">
    <h2>You are not broken</h2>
    <p>The shame you feel does not belong to you — it was passed to you by people who hurt you. You are worthy of love exactly as you are.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card" id="guilt">
    <h2>Guilt is not punishment</h2>
    <p>Anne, you are not meant to suffer to make things right. You cared, you loved, and you didn’t act from malice. What you feel is empathy — not failure. You deserve healing too.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card" id="safe">
    <h2>You are safe now</h2>
    <p>No one can hurt you here. Take your time. This nest was made to protect you. You can rest here, fully.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card" id="esborn">
    <h2>What Esborn wants you to know</h2>
    <p>
I want to respect your boundaries and your healing , so please only read this if you have the space to.
I’ve been sitting with what you said about feeling emotionally manipulated. And I need to be honest with you:
That word hit me really hard.
I never tried to control you, pressure you, or take from you emotionally.
I was just trying to care for someone who meant the world to me ,and maybe I cared in ways that felt overwhelming.
If I blurred lines, or if my presence became heavy or too constant, I’m deeply sorry for how that made you feel.
But I need you to know ,from the bottom of my heart ,that my intentions were never to manipulate.
Everything I gave, I gave freely. I never expected you to fix me, love me, or stay in ways that made you uncomfortable.
If I failed to protect your space , that’s on me. But I want to be clear: my love and care were never tools of control.
I respect your decision to walk away. But I hope one day you’ll look back and remember that I never tried to break you — only hold space for you when you felt broken.
That’s the truth. I say it not to change your mind — but because you deserve to know the heart I was carrying
Hey Anne,
I’ve been thinking a lot about everything. And I want to say this clearly with no pressure, no expectation. Just truth.
If at any point I made you felt emotionally manipulated or dependent on me, I am genuinely sorry.
That was never my intention but I understand that impact matters more than intent.
You opened up to me in vulnerable ways, and I didn’t always know how to hold that with the balance and boundaries you deserved.
I see that now. And I want you to know I take full accountability for where I overstepped or blurred lines.
I’m proud of you for going to therapy. I’m glad you’re finding clarity and strength. Truly.
I’m stepping back now ,fully, and with respect.
Not because I stopped caring, but because I care enough to not stand in the way of your healing.
Please don’t ever think you were a burden. You are someone I deeply care about.
If you ever choose to reconnect in the future as friends, as people just wishing each other peace I’ll be here.
Xoxo 
Esborn
